# Notes

### Predictive analysis

Use lots of data + machine learning to draw predictions
- ex: Predicting which products will be popular to start a marketing campaign
- ex: Find ways to attack the Chain of Transmission (for diseases)

Is important for corporate competition

Follows steps:
- Establish problem, know where to get data
- Get + refine data
- Find patterns in data
- Find algorithm for predictions
- Train the algorithm/model (this is machine learning!)
- Make predictions
- Refine the algorithm/model over time

Hi! I'm Leonard Wright and I am a student at Del Norte High School. You should check my about me for more of that stuff.

Here is a table of my activities.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Trimester</th>
        <th>Week</th>
        <th>Activities Completed</th>
    </tr>
    {% assign Trimester = "1; 1; 1" | split: ';' %}
    {% assign Week = "0; 1; 2" | split: ';' %}
    {% assign Description = "Installed essential programs, got this website up; Made notes page, integrated school contents, made python and bash scripts; Made loops in python (for loops, while loops, recursive loops). Made a list of dictionaries. Customized my fastpages site." | split: ';' %}
    {% for i in Week %}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ Trimester[i] }}</td>
        <td>{{ Week[i] }}</td>
        <td>{{ Description[i] }}</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>



| Trimester | Week | Activities Completed |
|-|-|-|
| Trimester 1 | Week 0 | Installed essential programs, got this website up |
| Trimester 1 | Week 1 | Made notes page, integrated school contents, made python and bash scripts |
| Trimester 1 | Week 2 | Make loops in python (for loops, while loops, recursive loops). Made a list of dictionaries. Customized my fastpages site. | 

If you're wondering where all my posts went, I hid most of them (other than the review tickets... and the word documents; I don't know how to clean up the latter part) since all the jupyter notebooks and markdown pages would make a mess. If you want to see all my pages, you should go to the [tags page instead.](https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/categories/)

Hi! I'm Leonard Wright and I am a student at Del Norte High School. You should check my about me for more of that stuff.

Here is a progress report of my activities. I'll try to find a way to turn this into a table later, since HTML isn't markdown.

Week 0: Installed essential programs, got this website up |
Week 1: TBD 

But other than that, I'll let the posts do the talking. For now.

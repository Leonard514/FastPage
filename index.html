Hi! I'm Leonard Wright and I am a student at Del Norte High School. You should check my about me for more of that stuff.

Here is a week-by-week table of my work.
| Week Number | Activities completed |
|-|-|
| Week 0 | Installed essential programs, got this website up |
| Week 1 | TBD |

But other than that, I'll let the posts do the talking. For now.

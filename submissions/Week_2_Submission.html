<p>This is part of the Week 2 Review Ticket. If you came here, I hope you came here from the github issue. If not, please take a look right <a href="https://github.com/Leonard514/FastPage/issues/5">here</a>. That being said, if you missed where the python is, it’s <a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/scripts/loop_scripts">here</a>!</p>

<p>Anyways, if you came from the github issue, you are probably here for the fastpages/web development part of the submission. That part of the submission is too complex to just stick a single link in the title without a dedicated post, so here’s to the changes!</p>

<h2 id="changes">
<a class="anchor" href="#changes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes!!!</h2>

<p>There are quite a few things in the HTML hacks that I have had previously for a while. In case you missed the tags and search pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/categories/">Tags</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/search/">Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My website has plenty of “time box fragments” (otherwise known as tables), including the one below. If you want to see a lot of tables, you should see my <a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/_pages/02_notes.html#week-1-python-vocab">notes page.</a></p>

<p>Also, you probably noticed that my website has a different color scheme. Specifically, my top bar is black while the rest of the background is navy blue. I had to make quite a few customizations to an example dark mode file (as well as the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastpages-styles.scss</code> file) to change the colors of the background and the text to ensure a dark background and text with sufficient contrast.</p>

<p>I also had an adventure modifying the theme of my website. For notes about that adventure, click <a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/_pages/02_notes.html#week-2-html-notes">here.</a>. I decided to remove the theme since it removed the top bar, making it harder to access the tags page.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>August 29</td>
      <td>First attempt at theme integration using _config.yml. The theme was not inputted correctly, breaking the CI task in fastpages and making it impossible to update the website.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>August 30</td>
      <td>Learned about dictionaries in a list in python. Added new information into the given list of dictionaries InfoDB, and demonstrated how to output list items backwards and in a random order.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>August 31</td>
      <td>Attempted to make a python quiz using a new list of dictionaries QuizDB, but got stuck due to various issues within the for loop and since I was appending my question/answer pairs to InfoDb instead of QuizDB. Also tried to append to a list using input and had trouble due to quotation issues. I eventually fixed the issue using f”{var_name}”, which allowed printing of any variable value inside the quotation marks. Also learned about how I inputted my website theme wrong in a lesson, and revised that. Had trouble customizing dark mode example code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>September 1</td>
      <td>Was able to customize dark mode, making all parts of the website except the top bar navy blue (the top bar is the default dark-mode color)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>September 2</td>
      <td>Customized the text color to contrast sufficiently with the background.</td>

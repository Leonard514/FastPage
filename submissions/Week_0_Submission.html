<p>This is a submission for the Tools/Equipment hack. If you want to see index.html, you might as well check out home.</p>

<p>Anyways, better start showing you my stuff. My main github is <a href="https://github.com/Leonard514/FastPage">here</a>. You were probably interested in seeing the insights page as well, so I’ll stick it in <a href="https://github.com/Leonard514/FastPage/pulse">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you also wanted to see me using VSCode, which is how I’m writing this page.</p>

<h2 id="vscode">
<a class="anchor" href="#vscode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>VSCODE</h2>
<p><img src="/FastPage/images/VSCODE.png" alt="" title="Me writing my about me page"></p>
<h2 id="notebook">
<a class="anchor" href="#notebook" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notebook</h2>
<p>And then there’s my Jupyter notebook, which is found at this <a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/2022/08/22/print_test.html">link</a>. Yeah, I know it has the default title. Going to have to ask around to figure out how that stuff works.</p>

<p>Anyways that’s all the submission-related stuff, but I think it’s also a good idea to keep a journal… of what I’ve done, and what I have left to do.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#here-is-a-table-of-my-progress" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Here is a table of my progress.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Refine the Jupyter Notebook (having a title, markdown integration)</li>
  <li>Image integration working fine, although I need a way to control resolution (since some images are massive)</li>
</ul>

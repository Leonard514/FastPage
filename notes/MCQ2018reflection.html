<p>This blog post is for reflection on multiple choice questions that I found to be particularly difficult. These include questions that I got wrong as well as questions that I found to be particularly difficult. I will not go over all of the questions to reduce vulnerabilities in the integrity system.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection</h1>

<p>Here are a few of the questions that were of interest.</p>

<h2 id="question-3-citizen-science">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-3-citizen-science" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 3: Citizen Science!!!</h2>

<p>Apparently citizen science exists. I’ve never heard of this before. If there’s anything I’m guessing this has something to do with involving a group of people representative of the population.</p>

<h2 id="question-16-and-the-digital-millenium-copyright-act">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-16-and-the-digital-millenium-copyright-act" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 16 and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act</h2>

<p>I was 50% certain when I was taking the test that this was legislation that was proposed, protested against, and ultimately never happened. Regardless, the music seller was licensed, so I thought copyright infringement was unlikely.
TODO: Look it up.</p>

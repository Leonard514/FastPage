<a class="anchor" href="#statement-of-intention" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Statement of Intention</h1>

<p>This blog post is for reflection on multiple choice questions that I found to be particularly difficult. These include questions that I got wrong as well as questions that I found to be particularly difficult. I will not go over all of the questions to reduce vulnerabilities in the integrity system.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection</h1>

<p>Here are a few of the questions that were of interest.</p>

<h2 id="question-3-citizen-science">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-3-citizen-science" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 3: Citizen Science!!!</h2>

<p>Apparently citizen science exists. I’ve never heard of this before. I thought this had something to do with involving a group of people representative of the population, but after watching a MyAP video, I realized this had more to do with crowdsourcing. This specifically had to do with everyday people using programs to partake in distributed computing to solve problems. The practice exam also talked about collecting data.</p>

<h2 id="question-9-iterative-and-incremental-processes-of-development">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-9-iterative-and-incremental-processes-of-development" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 9: Iterative and Incremental Processes of Development</h2>

<p>By far the hardest since I actually guessed this one. Conceptually, this was taking small steps in the development process by coding various components of a program sequentially. This allows for easier debugging since the time when an error appears can be matched with the development timeline.</p>

<h2 id="question-16-and-the-digital-millenium-copyright-act">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-16-and-the-digital-millenium-copyright-act" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 16 and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act</h2>

<p>I was 50% certain when I was taking the test that this was legislation that was proposed, protested against, and ultimately never happened. Regardless, the music seller was licensed, so I thought copyright infringement was unlikely. When I looked it up, I found out it actually happened and was passed to address new forms of piracy via the Internet, but that enforcement has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hacker-lexicon-digital-millennium-copyright-act/">occasionally been used for reasons unrelated to copyright</a> (ex: transferring music between two devices owned by the same person)</p>

<h2 id="question-35-minimizing-risk-of-copyright-violations">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-35-minimizing-risk-of-copyright-violations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 35: Minimizing risk of copyright violations</h2>

<p>I’m familiar with potential copyright violations for publishing videos that involve music from copyrighted works. Creative Commons sounds pretty good, and to be very specific, the creative commons no rights reserved license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a>) allows individuals to relinquish copyright and other restrictions, thereby simulating public domain. This seems good.</p>

<h2 id="question-53-why-machine-learning">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-53-why-machine-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 53: Why machine learning?</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">IBM</a>, machine learning is a part of AI where algorithms are used for computers to imitate human learning. The article goes on to say that machine learning is important for data science in looking for patterns and making predictions based on data.</p>

<h2 id="question-58-crowdsourcing">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-58-crowdsourcing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 58: Crowdsourcing</h2>

<p>As I said before, I watched the MyAP video. Other than distributed computing, I also learned about platforms where people can go to upload code and have other people download and modify the code. This can facilitate troubleshooting for bugs. There are some problems that cannot be solved in a reasonable time regardless of distributed computing, and my failure to account for this issue led to mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="question-64-cloud-computing">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-64-cloud-computing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 64: Cloud Computing</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">IBM</a>, cloud computing allows for access to computing resources via the Internet. This prevents people from having to buy all their own resources (ex: Google’s servers do the searching). There are some security concerns, such as encryption of data, data ownership, the cloud provider having to secure their infrastructure. Since this allows more people to partake in computer science, I can see why this promotes teamwork.</p>

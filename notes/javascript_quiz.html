console.log(correct);
onEvent("Results", "mouseover", function( ) {
  setText("scorereport", "Congratulations!!! You got " + ((correct + "/3") + " correct!!!"));
});
```
</details>

<p>We started coding the designs. code.org uses Javascript. We first defined a variable.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var correct = 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command sets a variable <strong>correct</strong> to 0</p>

<p>We then used the onEvent command to configure what happens when buttons or textboxes were clicked. A sample is visible below.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>onEvent("StartButton", "click", function( ) {
  setScreen("Question1");
});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar to if statements, loops, and other commands, <strong>onEvent</strong> has associated commands.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first criteria of <strong>onEvent</strong>, <strong>StartButton</strong>, defines what object the command applies to. This is an app, so there are objects such as buttons, textboxes, and images.</li>
  <li>The second criteria, <strong>click</strong>, determines the action which triggers the command.</li>
  <li>The associated command is setScreen, which as implies sets the screen to the named screen (in this case <strong>Question1</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>There were many onEvent commands which were highly similar.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>onEvent("reykjavik", "click", function __() {
  console.log("reykjavik clicked!");
  correct ++;
  console.log(correct);
  setScreen("Question2");});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does a few more things. <strong>console.log</strong>  prints the text inside the parenthesis and quotes to console. It can also print the value of a variable (in this case <strong>correct</strong>). This was extremely useful for debugging purposes, as I will elaborate on shortly.</p>

<p>correct ++ simply increases the value of the correct variable by 1.</p>

<p>I will now discuss the primary issue we encountered in the project.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>setText("scorereport", ("Congratulations!!! You got " + correct) + "/3" + " correct!!!");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command was placed at the very end of our code. It essentially put the text into the textbox named <strong>scorereport</strong> Whenever we ran the code, we found that at the end the score was either 0 or undefined.</p>

<p>In order to figure out the issues, we used a command which was seen in the second <strong>onEvent</strong> command</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log(correct);</code></p>

<p>Using this, we found that the variable <strong>correct</strong> was indeed increasing if the correct answers to the questions were selected. Therefore, the issue was that the last line of code was run before the quiz was even taken (when the variable correct was 0). To solve this issue, we made the <strong>setText</strong> command to be executed as part of an <strong>onEvent</strong> command. Here was the final version of the command.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onEvent("Results", "mouseover", function( ) {
  setText("scorereport", "Congratulations!!! You got " + ((correct + "/3") + " correct!!!"));
});
</code></p>

<p>The <strong>Results</strong> page was the final page where the score was displayed. The event was <strong>mouseover</strong>, which is essentially if the mouse is over the page. This made it so the command was executed only when the quiz taker entered the page, ensuring that the correct value for the number of correct answers was outputted.</p>

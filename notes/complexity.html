<p>Programmers care about space complexity because they want to make sure that their computer programs consume a reasonable amount of resources to function. If programs consume too much memory to function, they may crash the computers they run on (especially if this is a product intended to be installed on consumer machines; these machines will have limited memory). Programmers care about time complexity because they want to ensure their programs run in a reasonable amount of time. If programs run too slowly (ex: a search engine taking a minute to pull up results), this decreases ease of use. From a corporate perspective, slow programs are not that competitive and will not make profits.</p>

<p>Programmers care about space complexity because they want to make sure that their computer programs consume a reasonable amount of resources to function. If programs consume too much memory to function, they may crash the computers they run on (especially if this is a product intended to be installed on consumer machines; these machines will have limited memory). Programmers care about time complexity because they want to ensure their programs run in a reasonable amount of time. If programs run too slowly (ex: a search engine taking a minute to pull up results), this decreases ease of use. From a corporate perspective, slow programs are not that competitive and will not make profits.</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading time for 5000 pixels in width took between 0.1 and 0.5 seconds.</li>
  <li>Loading time for 2500 pixels in width took less time</li>
  <li>Loading time for greater image resolution has slowed down performance and in some cases has crashed the kernel. The maximum width of 40000 pixels took 30-60 seconds to load (if it did)</li>
</ul>

<p>Loading large images is both a space complexity and a time complexity problem. The space complexity is through managing</p>

<p>Big O notation</p>

<ul>
  <li>Constant O(1)</li>
  <li>Linear On</li>
  <li>Quadratic On^2</li>
  <li>Logarithmic Olog(n)</li>
  <li>Exponential O2^n</li>
</ul>

<p>Constant</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding number in a list with a known index</li>
  <li>Dictionary (keys and values)
    <ul>
      <li>An example of time complexity (will take the same time to fetch the object)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Space complexity: returning a sum of two numbers (no matter how large those numbers are)</li>
</ul>

<p>Linear</p>
<ul>
  <li>Iterating through list (not as efficient as constant) - Time
    <ul>
      <li>Searching for a value in a list with unknown index</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Space: Reversing the order of a list</li>
</ul>

<p>Quadratic</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nested for loop operation (time)</li>
  <li>Space complexity - Matrix - this may take a while</li>
</ul>

<p>Logarithm - shorter than 0(n)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Binary Search - elements in order, do number in center, adjust search based on if element is above or below that part</li>
</ul>

<p>Exponential (2^n)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fibonacci sequence, series of numbers and each number is sum of two preceding numbers. Do recursion with CRUD menu…</li>
  <li>As numbers increase, the function will take a while to execute.</li>
  <li>Generate subset will print every possible combination of a list of numbers. This will make many additional combinations very quickly.</li>

<p>I started by testing all the algorithm stuff. I should probably paste this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list">URL</a> here since it’ll let me execute python without Jupyter.</p>

<p>Now here’s a table</p>

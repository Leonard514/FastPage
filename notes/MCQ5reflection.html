<p>This blog post is for reflection on multiple choice questions that I found to be particularly difficult. These include questions that I got wrong as well as questions that I found to be particularly difficult. I will not go over all of the questions to reduce vulnerabilities in the integrity system.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection</h1>

<p>Here are a few of the questions that were of interest.</p>

<p>Question 7: What is assigned to a new computer after connecting to the Internet?</p>

<p>There was an option here that I had never heard of despite previous experience with computer networking, and that is called a packet number. I am familiar with the idea of data transmissions via packets through networks from servers to clients. According to this <a href="https://www.liveaction.com/resources/blog/network-packet/#:~:text=The%20packet%20number%20%E2%80%93%20each%20packet,part%20of%20the%20complete%20information.">source</a>, packet numbers are identifiers within a packet saying where within a set of data the packet fits and how many packets comprise the set of data. The debate about what packet numbers are assigned to is therefore closed.</p>

<p>I am familiar with computers being assigned IP addresses through a process known as <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-dhcp/">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a>. Essentially, a DHCP server (which could be a standalone server or a router) assigns a computer an IP address for a finite period of time. This address comes from a pool of available addresses. It is actually possible to manually configure your computer IP address, but DHCP is more scalable for larger networks (ex: the school network) and is less susceptible to IP address conflicts (computers must have unique IP addresses to properly receive network packets).</p>

<p>The <strong>init</strong> method is the constructor for all of the objects related to the users.</p>

<p>The following notes about the class User</p>

<p>The db.Model is the parameter for the creation of the class User. In Object Orienting Program, information is taken from the database (info inherited from db.Model).</p>

<p>For each attribute, @property (getter) and a setter. For getting and CRUD (create, read, update, delete), getting may correspond to Creating, Reading, and Updating.</p>

<p>The class added breakpoints to u6 and to u2 of the <strong>Initial Data</strong> code segment. initUsers() at the bottom is highlighted since the function is not run until the final line calls it. All the user information is contained within the call to the class defined as 6 user-variables.</p>

<p>sqlite database under notebooks &gt; files</p>

<p>It is good to convert data at the end to JSON because this is a universal language; this allows it to be more usable (ex: using APIs)</p>

<h2 id="block-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#block-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Block 1</h2>

<p>The first code block starts by importing libraries and starting a flask instance. It finds the sqlite.db file and sets a few configurations related to Flask and SQLAlchemy, including the secret key and where the database file is. THe <strong>SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS</strong> setting is set to false; this saves system resources according to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33738467/how-do-i-know-if-i-can-disable-sqlalchemy-track-modifications">stackexchange</a></p>

<p>Here are some notes from the prompts on the blog</p>

<p>The first portion I’ll dedicate to the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app = Flask(__name__).</code> According to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-do-we-pass-__name__-to-the-flask-class/">more well-known sources</a>, this command starts a Flask instance, which is used to fetch resources required to run a program. A <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/why-do-we-pass-name-to-the-flask-class">personal blog</a> went into more specific detail about how that works. According to that blog, a function is called which finds the root path of the application being executed.</p>

<h2 id="block-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#block-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Block 2</h2>

<p>This imports more libraries and is also where the class <strong>User</strong> is defined. At that, various columns for the SQL database are defined (including the <strong>_name</strong>, <strong>_uid</strong>, <strong>_password</strong>, and <strong>_dob</strong>). There are configurations for the maximum length (indicated to be 255 characters by <strong>db.string(255)</strong>, and the _uid must be unique (unique=True).</p>

<p>After all of these definitions, the <strong>__init__</strong> function is defined, which constructs the object of the User class. These include configurations for the name, uid, password, and date of birth. There are then a series of getter functions to obtain these stored attributes from the object and setter functions for updating this data for the object. There are some differences for how the passwords are handled: only the first 10 characters of each password can be shown, and when passwords are set, they are hashed with SHA256. There is also checking for matching uid, password matching, and an age calculator. When necessary, these is a function to obtain the data and output it in JSON format for API use. Finally, there are functions which execute each of the 4 procedures related to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete).</p>

<h2 id="block-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#block-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Block 3</h2>

<p>The block starts by defining function <strong>initUsers</strong>. The function creates a database and inserts information for 6 users in accordance with the class <strong>User</strong>. This information includes names, uids, passwords, and dates of birth. THese users are then sent into a list <strong>users</strong> and loops through the list. A for loop is then utilized to add each user of the list into the table, along with printing output based on if each user was successfully added to the list. If not, the print message says there was a duplicate uid or other error.</p>

<p>After the function was defined, the function is called and executed.</p>

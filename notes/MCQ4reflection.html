<p>This blog post is for reflection on multiple choice questions that I found to be particularly difficult. These include questions that I got wrong as well as questions that I found to be particularly difficult. I will not go over all of the questions to reduce vulnerabilities in the integrity system.</p>

<h1 id="reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection</h1>

<p>I did get a perfect score. Of all the available questions, one question stood out.</p>

<p>Question Prompt: There are 4 spreadsheets relating to students, GPA, and sports</p>

<p>i) Name, ID, GPA
ii) ID, names of sports
iii) Name, ID (only includes 3.5+ GPA)
iv) Name, ID (only includes 2+ sports)</p>

<p>Goal: Are students that play sports more likely to have greater/lesser GPAs than those who don’t?</p>

<p>Spreadsheet (iv) is irrelevant since this excludes students who play exactly 1 sport. As such, spreadsheet (ii) was necessary. The question was whether to select (i) or (iii). In order to determine this, there should be a method to determine whether a given spreadsheet meets the goal.</p>

<p>In order to reach the goal, ideally we could find the proportion of sports students with a GPA cutoff (# sports students with the GPA / total # sports students). Execute a similar procedure for students who don’t play sports. Then, compare the ratios and see if the sports students have a ratio significantly different from that of the non-sports students. The total number of students who play sports and the total number of students who don’t play sports are required to find this ratio, and this requires Spreadsheet (i); spreadsheet (iii) doesn’t give total students. Therefore, spreadsheet (i) was most appropriate.</p>

<p>All the other questions were relatively quick, and a significant portion of the questions were recycled from previously administered quizzes. That’s why I don’t have too much to say here.</p>

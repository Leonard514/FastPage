</ul><p>Alright, where to start? I got three weeks worth of work here. Apparently I’m supposed to grade 10 create performance task submissions and compare them to college board. I guess the following is below</p>

<p>The rubric is <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf">attached</a> for reference. There are also some <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf">prompts</a> to be aware of.</p>

<p>Alright, now I’ll start Week 1 I guess</p>

<p>Expect this to be a bit rough since this is my first one. I’m usually quite harsh, and I’m expecting College Board to be pretty lenient. Alright, let’s see what’s here.</p>

The written response includes the inputs and outputs, a certain functionality of the code through the output (trignometric table and side ratios). It is difficult to tell if program purpose is confused with program function, though it seems it is.</td>
      <td>0</td>

      <td>A list and its fulfilling of the programs purpose are clear. The list, however, is used to store potential outputs (namely the type of triangle), not inputs. The list is named appropriately. The data in the list is represented clearly. I’m going to assume using an output-storage list is not going to be a problem.</td>

      <td>Managing Complexity</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>A list is shown as managing output complexity. The student posits that without the list, the types of triangles will have to be put in the return statements, meaning the types of triangles supported are not all in one place. This solution seems to be plausible, as does the use of the list. The student notes that with a list, modification of code is easier since the types of triangles are found in one place.</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Putting all the outputs in one place is not management of complexity, especially since the return statements is a simple replacement. We’re looking for something different here. Perhaps I have an idea. The student never showed the code behind the trignometric table scheme, and though each value shown requires but a simple calculation, there are 18 outputs to manage. A list could probably be used to manage complexity in this instance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>The code segments clearly show a student-developed procedure with three parameters (each are essential); the procedure is called soon after it is defined. The student identifies what the procedure does (outputs the ratio of the entered triangular sides) and connects the procedure to the program’s function, namely its output being required as part of the user-received output</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>The procedure is written and called, with three parameters. The functionality and contribution to the program is stated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>The student makes a line-by-line explanation of what the algorithm does, though there is no explanation of the overall function of each portion of code (in other words, each line is explained separately). This may make it difficult to understand the function of certain portions of the algorithm until Question 3d is reached. There is sequencing, selection (two if statements), and iteration (depending on if the triangular sides can be simplified). Unfortunately, when explaining the for loop in the code, the student claims that the index will decrease from the <em>maximum</em> of previously defined constants (A, B, and C), when in reality it will decrease from the <em>minimum</em> of those constants (uses the python <strong>min(A, B, C)</strong> command). Therefore, I cannot award the point even if there was a solid line-by-line explanation, because the code described does not match the description.</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Looks like College Board wasn’t paying attention and missed the error. Under normal AP grading conditions where administrators are given little time to grade hundreds of exams, this would be somewhat understandable. However, it’s a little surprising that the scores don’t get reviewed before they’re posted as examples on the official website.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Testing</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>This one is a bit difficult to work with. The student gives two different inputs and proceeds to state that the first conditional statement (which checks if the given integers are as simplified as possible) is checked for both of them. For the second call, the student also references the remainders conditional statement (in the for loop), which is executed since the first conditional statement failed to pass for the second call. The student is accurate to state that the first if statement is checked for both arguments, and technically part of the code is executed for both calls (that being the first conditional statement). I think I’ll let it slide since the way the algorithm treats the two inputs overall is different.</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Two calls with different arguments are described, which result in different code segments being executed. The student identifies the output of each call.</td>
    </tr>

<p>Kind of messy as expected. I guess it’s time for Round 2.</p>

This is an identification of the name of the lists, whose purpose (according to the written response) is to store the status of the 10800 cells on the screen using booleans (0 = dead; 1 = alive). The student says there are three lists to prevent overwriting issues as the program cycles through each generation. There are two code segments provided, and it is clear when the lists are being modified and how they are used to define program purpose. The definitions of the lists are not shown, probably since each list is 10800 elements long. However, the first procedure shows how the initial values of the elements in <strong>startGrid</strong> are set (through mouse input).</td>

After each attempt, the program outputs the word with highlighted letters; the green highlights are correct, while yellow highlighted letters are present in the word but misplaced (the words have unique letters). Red highlighted letters are not present in the word. If the student guesses correctly within 6 tries, there’s a win (otherwise it’s a loss). The written response has a program purpose of critical thinking skills. Nice. The student talks about the inputs of clicking the help button (for a guide) or a turtle (to start a game), as well as typing inputs for each guess. The output was each word with the colored highlights and a win/lose screen at the end of each game. The student then started to describe the sequence of events in the video (which I believe is not what students are supposed to do), so program functionality may not be explicitly stated. Grading this one may be tricky due to the unexpected response. I’ll just lift something directly off of College Board to help. “The function is the behavior of a program during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.” I guess describing the events of the video passes for program functionality since a user interacted with the program during the video.</td>

It seems more accurate to say that the algorithm will not have output for inputs of at least 9 letters and accept any input less than 9 letters. Regardless, the explanation goes on to talk about the conditional statements assigning letter highlights and about how this is iterated for each of the 8 letters. It then talks about changing the screen upon winning or losing, and mentions running out of guesses.

<p>I wanted to find this program and test what happens when you input a word less than 8 letters long, and I found it <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/651435403/">here</a>. I inputted the word <em>break</em>, and it seems that if the word runs out of letters then it just fills in the last space with copies of the last letter. There’s a few other quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inputting unknown characters will duplicate the previously-used letter on the display, though the program still detects when the true values of the inputs fail to match</li>
  <li>Inputs greater than 8 characters will still count towards failed inputs</li>
  <li>Inputting numbers will map them to the corresponding letters of the alphabet (1 is a, 2 is b)</li>
</ul>

Hi! I'm Leonard Wright, and I am a student at Del Norte High School.
This website is currently being maintained for AP Computer Science Principles.
I do have some experience securing computers, and I guess this class will be more about learning to code code code!!!
I hear we'll be working in groups a lot in this class. I hope I can also learn about working with others in this class (I had a hard time with this in 11th grade, though recently I've learned a few things so hopefully things get better). I'll need collaboration skills in college and the workforce anyways, so best to start practicing now.

Anyways other than that I guess I can mention I'm in Ms. Lanzi's BC class (wish me luck). She does a good job with integrating group work into the course structure. That's a plus since I could learn collaboration skills in that class as well as here.

I don't know what else to say, I guess I'll add more stuff here later

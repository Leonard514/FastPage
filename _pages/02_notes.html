  <li>She sent a survey about what students thought about Yale culture; students are stressed about being in Yale and can’t enjoy pleasures or take advantage of opportunities</li>
  <li>40% of college students have greater than average stress, a third have severe depression, more than 40% have lack of hope, etc.</li>
  <li>Santos therefore wanted to help using her knowledge in psychology (including positive psychology, where happy people are studied, and behavior change, to figure out how to change habits)… and made a course about it (Psychology and the good life)</li>
  <li>2 parts: positive psychology and the <em>practice</em> of the good life. To build this practice, rewiring habits became part of the syllabus (including gratitude, social connection, sleep, etc.)</li>
  <li>No changes to syllabus upon submission, became popular</li>

<ol>
  <li>Happiness is controllable and can be improved (some is controlled by heritability, but not all)</li>
  <li>Location of residence, salary, and other life circumstances matter less than we think (positive and negative events have a temporary impact on happiness). Therefore, removing the “bad stuff” isn’t the way to maximize happiness.</li>
  <li>It is challenging (but possible) to become happier. This requires building daily habits that happy people have. The agile methodology, like the “Good Life” course, requires that habits be built. These habits will include having a daily standup meeting for planning and task delegation, maintaining issues for short-term tasks and the scrum board for organizing those tasks. This ensures that tasks are completed at a consistent pace in accordance with the agile methodology (Principle 8).
    <ul>
      <li>GI Joe Fallacy: A cartoon claimed knowing a concept/skill is half the work, and that is false. The skill must also be put into practice, and that’s the majority of the work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Intuitions about happiness <strong>can be inaccurate</strong>. The mind forecasts about what makes us happy (ex: salary, possessions), but increases in these things do not correlate with significant increases in happiness.</li>
  <li>Happy people make time for social connections (spend more time with others). The agile framework would require working and with other people on computer projects. Communication in the agile framework requires in-person, face-to-face conversation (principle 6). This teamwork makes potential for social connections between effective group members, and this in turn may enhance happiness.</li>
  <li>Helping others helps us (more than we expect) by making us happy. Helping others is integrated into the agile framework as when a student is having trouble with code, other group members can work with that student and teach how to fix the issue (this is also part of leadership skills) to help the group move along (Principle 4). This willingness to share help will ultimately lead to a better project and help with learning programming… along with the happiness along the way that comes with being helpful.</li>
  <li>Make time for gratitude… daily. Happy people think/talk about the better people (rather than the annoying people). Writing down a list of good events daily increases happiness. It is also good to write a letter of gratitude and read it in-person to the person you are thanking. This reading of the letter connects the most with Agile Principle 6 (face-to-face conversation is the most effective mode of communication)</li>
  <li>Healthy practice matter <em>more</em> than we think (exercise, sleep, etc.) Workouts has been shown to boost happiness for the day, while sleep deprivation significantly decreased happiness, some to depression levels.</li>
  <li>Mindfulness (be in the present). Mindfulness is being aware of present sensory input (ex: how your feet feel when you stand, the room temperature, any sounds perceived, the color of your dish, etc.). More time spend in mindfulness is correlated with greater happiness, even compared to thinking about pleasant but non-present things.</li>
  <li>Become wealthy… in terms of <em>time</em>. Time famine is being too busy… and time affluence is the opposite. People maximizing time affluence are happier.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote my letter to my teacher, Mr. Yeung. I was having a problem working with a group member, as I was helping him along every step of the way through setup. This left me with no time to do my own work in class. So I emailed him about the issue, and he told me to tell my partner three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consult the blog/guide and read through the steps</li>
  <li>If confused, ask me for help. Ask after 5 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue.</li>
  <li>If I was too busy or didn’t know how to help, ask Mr. Yeung for help.</li>
</ol>

<p>This allowed me to spend time during class working on my computer projects, and it also helped my partner gain some degree of independence during the learning process. I especially saw value in having group members consult a guide. This was very reassuring for me, especially since I tend to have anxiety during the early parts of a class (due to familiarization with class format and the like). So to thank him, I wrote him my letter. I already gave the letter to him at the time of writing, so I can’t copy the contents… but I can paraphrase from memory</p>

<p>In the letter, I thanked him for replying to the email, and told him all the good things that stemmed from this reply: having more time to work on the project, my partner being able to learn with a degree of independence (that is, not fully relying on my help), an understanding that I can refer confused group members to guides so I can continue to help in other ways, and a boost in my collaboration skills which will be important for college and the workforce. I also admitted that working in groups has been a challenge for me, and afterwards thanked him for helping me address it.</p>

<p>When I finished reading the letter to him, he told me he was glad to help with my issue. As far as I remember, the happiness I experienced was not a rush… but more deep inside, like a calm. This could have been my anxiety/stress dissipating.</p>

<p>During the next class, I thought of an application of his advice in a context outside of school. I know that the practice in groups I will get in this class will be invaluable in the future.</p>

<p>I wrote my letter to my mother. I thanked her for helping me with an extracurricular activity last week, and I thanked her for helping me write an email about a concern with work in this class. She proceeded to give me all the credit for writing the email. I also thanked her for giving me good food and transporting me to school and other activities so that I can work with a clear mind, work in groups, and ask students and teachers for help with my work. I also thanked her for lending me her phone to ask my sister for help in AP Calculus BC, a tough course. I finally thanked her for her support in my efforts, especially any support that I haven’t given enough attention to.</p>

<p>My mother smiled and hugged me, and she asked why I was thanking her. When she asked if it was due to her help with improving my anxiety about this class (and other things), I nodded.</p>

<p>I felt it was nice that I made her happy by giving attention to everything she does to support me. Perhaps I can do this with other people as well.</p>

<h3 id="importing-a-theme">
<a class="anchor" href="#importing-a-theme" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Importing a Theme</h3>
<p>Pictures say a thousand words. Therefore, I’ve integrated pictures to explain what’s going on with my site.</p>

<p>I attempted to integrate the midnight theme into my fastpages (at _config.yml). It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/theme1.png" alt="" title="First attempt at adding the Midnight theme to fastpages."></p>

<p>Upon uploading the modified _config.yml theme to my FastPage repository, I found out that there was no changes occurring. It was only some time later that I found that the CI task was consistently failing due to syntax errors in my _config.yml file.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/error.png" alt="" title="CI Error in Github Actions"></p>

<p>Every CI task was failing when I did the commit. The syntax error in _config.yml effectively made it impossible to update my website. It was then that I was told that I was not supposed to put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">midnight</code>, but rather <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages-themes/midnight@v0.2.0</code> in the remote theme configuration of _config.yml. Upon adding the fix, the CI tasks worked again.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/theme2.png" alt="" title="Second attempt at adding Midnight theme to fastpages"></p>

<p>This fix was a success. The midnight theme was applied. I have some before/after images.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/before.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/after.PNG" alt=""></p>

<p>There is a very noteworthy change that comes with implementation of the midnight theme: the top bar of the website is removed. This top bar includes my most crucial pages (the search page, the tags page, this page, and my about me). Removal of easy access to the tags page is a special concern, since this serves as the backbone of organization for my website. As a result, the theme change is temporary.</p>

<h3 id="modifying-dark-mode">
<a class="anchor" href="#modifying-dark-mode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modifying dark mode</h3>

<p>This one was interesting. I imported all the sample code, then had to modify it. The default code made the background of the website all-black, but something just wasn’t right. The top bar had the same color as the rest of the page. Therefore, I had two goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make the color of the top bar different from the body</li>
  <li>Define a second color to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now of course the file in question was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/sass/minima/dark-mode.scss</code>. Now of course I had to define the second color first. I thought navy blue would fit, so I made a new color named <strong>navy-blue</strong>. Now the nice thing is that if you mouse-over the square of the color, a color picker opens up. That made changing the color very easy.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/color.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Then I had to figure out how to make the top bar a different color. Since I wanted navy-blue to be my main color, I replaced all instances in the code where the background was <strong>dark-grey</strong> (the default color) with <strong>navy-blue</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/change.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The last thing I had to do was figure out which parts of the page constituted the top bar. A little use of inspect element on my own page helped a lot.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/header.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Using this, I found out that the site-header and site-nav parts of the site were in the top bar. So I set their background color to <strong>dark-grey.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/grey.PNG" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="tables-in-liquid">
<a class="anchor" href="#tables-in-liquid" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tables in Liquid</h3>

<p>I will not lie to you. This portion of the HTML hacks… with little sample code… was extremely difficult for me. It took me around 6 hours, searching through many websites… many reuploads of the page in question (which was index.html)… but onto the code…</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/liquid.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, what’s going on here? This is meant for the table on my front page <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>.</p>

<p>The first few lines are a bunch of HTML tags. The funny thing is, every time you make a tag (ex: &lt;table&gt;), you have to close it later (&lt;/table&gt;). So you got &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; (which probably stands for “table row”), and &lt;th&gt; (likely “table heading,” appropriately named since the first row is bolded and has its own background color). Then we close everything.</p>

<p>This is where the liquid starts. It took forever for me to get this right… mostly because I tried <em>many</em> things. But so you don’t have to go through all that, I’ll just explain what’s in front of you.</p>

<p>In liquid, your commands must go in percents and curly braces. That’s how it was made. Now the reason why I’m not going to actually type out any percents and curly braces is because the website will immediately think I’m running actual code and return errors when I take my liberties. This would effectively make it impossible to update this page… so whenever you see a command assume they are in curly braces and percents.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assign = var_name</code> makes a variable. But then you see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assign Trimester = "1; 1; 1" | split: ';'</code> Liquid has this funny thing about arrays, so in order to make one you have to put the whole thing in quotes, with each entry separated by a certain character… then you have to pipe it to a <strong>split</strong> command to tell liquid what character separates each entry (in this case, it was semicolon). I defined the other lists in a similar manner..</p>

<p>Next is the for loop, which as a reminder executes all associated commands for each iteration. In this case, we get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for i in (0..2)</code>. Conceptually, it’s not much different than the python for loops. It cycles through three values (0, 1, and 2), and executes the commands for each. It’s mostly the syntax that was a bother. You have to put the numbers in parenthesis, otherwise it just doesn’t work. You also separate the numbers with two periods.</p>

<p>We’ll then take a look at one of the associated commands.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This simply says that for each iteration (or cycle, the word I’ve used in my other posts so far), the item in the array associated with the value of the index variable will be used. Remember, the first item is associated with 0, the second item with 1, etc… in the Trimester list, the items are all <strong>1</strong>. The other commands are similar to this one, except for the <strong>Week</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> lists instead.</p>

<p>Unlike python, we have to tell liquid where the for loop is going to end. Because apparently the tabbing scheme doesn’t cut it. That’s what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">endfor</code> is for.</p>

<p>I guess there’s one last thing… I need to tell you where I got all this info from.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.codeshopify.com/blog_posts/building-arrays-with-liquid-in-shopify">Assigning a variable (includes split command)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Emaad-Mir/emaad-fastpages/blob/master/_pages/01_timebox.html">For loop syntax</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, the second one is someone else’s submission. I personally think looking at someone else’s code is a bit of a grey area in terms of academic honesty, and straight up copying it is prohibited. But then again the syntax is a bit rigid, so there’s not an easy way to make code without the syntax matching up. So to make myself feel a bit better about using someone’s submission as a reference, you can see there are a few differences (this student referenced some variables placed in _config.yml… which I don’t see as a suitable place to store variables, so I placed them in the related code instead). Gotta give credit where credit is due. Because honestly, this is all the example code I got. Mr. Yeung told me the more important part of the class is understanding how the code works, so if you think the explanation above was fair, then I guess I might be doing this right.</p>

<p>there are “number” instead of integer</p>

<p>There are still functions and such, though they are defined with <strong>function</strong> instead</p>

<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) allows for transmission of data (similar to Python lists and dictionaries) between files. A function can be used to put input into the data. The JSON makes the data a <em>string</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function Person(name, ghID, classOf) {
    this.name = name;
    this.ghID = ghID;
    this.classOf = classOf;
    this.role = "";
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can make an array using a variable like in Python, though making an array is significantly easier:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var var_name = [
        new OBJECT("Param1", "Param2", "Param3", "2022")

        :display:inline-block;" +
        "border: 2 px solid grey;" +

<ul>
  <li>Program = collection of program statements performing a specific task when executed</li>
  <li>Code segment = collection of program statements, part of program</li>
  <li>Program needs to collect variety of input</li>
  <li>Behavior = how program functions during execution</li>
  <li>Can be described broadly or by what program does and how it does it</li>

<ul>
  <li>Program/software = collection of statements</li>
  <li>Statement = 1 command</li>
  <li>Group of statements = code segment</li>
  <li>Code segments executed according to rules of programing language</li>
  <li>Can be seen in text or with blocky</li>

<p>Arrow is an assignment, value of <strong>aList[1]</strong> assigned to min
list groups together data</p>

<p>FOR EACH item IN aList: looks through each number, repeat associated commands</p>

<p>If the item is less than the minimum, then the item is the new minimum. After done for all elements, print the text</p>

<p>This program finds the minimum value in a list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Needs to work for a variety of lists</li>
  <li>Out-of-order numbers,</li>
  <li>negative numbers,</li>
  <li>larger numbers (especially a problem with 32-bit integer limit),</li>
  <li>decimals (some languages separate decimals from integers)</li>
  <li>Can be put in larger program</li>
</ul>

<p>Describing code segments</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe what it does so it could be re-used in a larger program</li>
  <li>Include how it does what it does</li>
  <li>Explain how it functions</li>
  <li>Allows people to make it better</li>

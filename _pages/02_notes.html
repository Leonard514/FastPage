  <li>She sent a survey about what students thought about Yale culture; students are stressed about being in Yale and can’t enjoy pleasures or take advantage of opportunities</li>
  <li>40% of college students have greater than average stress, a third have severe depression, more than 40% have lack of hope, etc.</li>
  <li>Santos therefore wanted to help using her knowledge in psychology (including positive psychology, where happy people are studied, and behavior change, to figure out how to change habits)… and made a course about it (Psychology and the good life)</li>
  <li>2 parts: positive psychology and the <em>practice</em> of the good life. To build this practice, rewiring habits became part of the syllabus (including gratitude, social connection, sleep, etc.)</li>
  <li>No changes to syllabus upon submission, became popular</li>

<ol>
  <li>Happiness is controllable and can be improved (some is controlled by heritability, but not all)</li>
  <li>Location of residence, salary, and other life circumstances matter less than we think (positive and negative events have a temporary impact on happiness). Therefore, removing the “bad stuff” isn’t the way to maximize happiness.</li>
  <li>It is challenging (but possible) to become happier. This requires building daily habits that happy people have. The agile methodology, like the “Good Life” course, requires that habits be built. These habits will include having a daily standup meeting for planning and task delegation, maintaining issues for short-term tasks and the scrum board for organizing those tasks. This ensures that tasks are completed at a consistent pace in accordance with the agile methodology (Principle 8).
    <ul>
      <li>GI Joe Fallacy: A cartoon claimed knowing a concept/skill is half the work, and that is false. The skill must also be put into practice, and that’s the majority of the work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Intuitions about happiness <strong>can be inaccurate</strong>. The mind forecasts about what makes us happy (ex: salary, possessions), but increases in these things do not correlate with significant increases in happiness.</li>
  <li>Happy people make time for social connections (spend more time with others). The agile framework would require working and with other people on computer projects. Communication in the agile framework requires in-person, face-to-face conversation (principle 6). This teamwork makes potential for social connections between effective group members, and this in turn may enhance happiness.</li>
  <li>Helping others helps us (more than we expect) by making us happy. Helping others is integrated into the agile framework as when a student is having trouble with code, other group members can work with that student and teach how to fix the issue (this is also part of leadership skills) to help the group move along (Principle 4). This willingness to share help will ultimately lead to a better project and help with learning programming… along with the happiness along the way that comes with being helpful.</li>
  <li>Make time for gratitude… daily. Happy people think/talk about the better people (rather than the annoying people). Writing down a list of good events daily increases happiness. It is also good to write a letter of gratitude and read it in-person to the person you are thanking. This reading of the letter connects the most with Agile Principle 6 (face-to-face conversation is the most effective mode of communication)</li>
  <li>Healthy practice matter <em>more</em> than we think (exercise, sleep, etc.) Workouts has been shown to boost happiness for the day, while sleep deprivation significantly decreased happiness, some to depression levels.</li>
  <li>Mindfulness (be in the present). Mindfulness is being aware of present sensory input (ex: how your feet feel when you stand, the room temperature, any sounds perceived, the color of your dish, etc.). More time spend in mindfulness is correlated with greater happiness, even compared to thinking about pleasant but non-present things.</li>
  <li>Become wealthy… in terms of <em>time</em>. Time famine is being too busy… and time affluence is the opposite. People maximizing time affluence are happier.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote my letter to my teacher, Mr. Yeung. I was having a problem working with a group member, as I was helping him along every step of the way through setup. This left me with no time to do my own work in class. So I emailed him about the issue, and he told me to tell my partner three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consult the blog/guide and read through the steps</li>
  <li>If confused, ask me for help. Ask after 5 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue.</li>
  <li>If I was too busy or didn’t know how to help, ask Mr. Yeung for help.</li>
</ol>

<p>This allowed me to spend time during class working on my computer projects, and it also helped my partner gain some degree of independence during the learning process. I especially saw value in having group members consult a guide. This was very reassuring for me, especially since I tend to have anxiety during the early parts of a class (due to familiarization with class format and the like). So to thank him, I wrote him my letter. I already gave the letter to him at the time of writing, so I can’t copy the contents… but I can paraphrase from memory</p>

<p>In the letter, I thanked him for replying to the email, and told him all the good things that stemmed from this reply: having more time to work on the project, my partner being able to learn with a degree of independence (that is, not fully relying on my help), an understanding that I can refer confused group members to guides so I can continue to help in other ways, and a boost in my collaboration skills which will be important for college and the workforce. I also admitted that working in groups has been a challenge for me, and afterwards thanked him for helping me address it.</p>

<p>When I finished reading the letter to him, he told me he was glad to help with my issue. As far as I remember, the happiness I experienced was not a rush… but more deep inside, like a calm. This could have been my anxiety/stress dissipating.</p>

<p>During the next class, I thought of an application of his advice in a context outside of school. I know that the practice in groups I will get in this class will be invaluable in the future.</p>

<p>I wrote my letter to my mother. I thanked her for helping me with an extracurricular activity last week, and I thanked her for helping me write an email about a concern with work in this class. She proceeded to give me all the credit for writing the email. I also thanked her for giving me good food and transporting me to school and other activities so that I can work with a clear mind, work in groups, and ask students and teachers for help with my work. I also thanked her for lending me her phone to ask my sister for help in AP Calculus BC, a tough course. I finally thanked her for her support in my efforts, especially any support that I haven’t given enough attention to.</p>

<p>My mother smiled and hugged me, and she asked why I was thanking her. When she asked if it was due to her help with improving my anxiety about this class (and other things), I nodded.</p>

<p>I felt it was nice that I made her happy by giving attention to everything she does to support me. Perhaps I can do this with other people as well.</p>

<p>Pictures say a thousand words. Therefore, I’ve integrated pictures to explain what’s going on with my site.</p>

<p>I attempted to integrate the midnight theme into my fastpages (at _config.yml). It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/theme1.png" alt="" title="First attempt at adding the Midnight theme to fastpages."></p>

<p>Upon uploading the modified _config.yml theme to my FastPage repository, I found out that there was no changes occurring. It was only some time later that I found that the CI task was consistently failing due to syntax errors in my _config.yml file.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/error.png" alt="" title="CI Error in Github Actions"></p>

<p>Every CI task was failing when I did the commit. The syntax error in _config.yml effectively made it impossible to update my website. It was then that I was told that I was not supposed to put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">midnight</code>, but rather <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages-themes/midnight@v0.2.0</code> in the remote theme configuration of _config.yml. Upon adding the fix, the CI tasks worked again.</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/HTML_Change/theme2.png" alt="" title="Second attempt at adding Midnight theme to fastpages"></p>

<p>This fix was a success. The midnight theme was applied. I have some before/after images.</p>

<p>There is a very noteworthy change that comes with implementation of the midnight theme: the top bar of the website is removed. This top bar includes my most crucial pages (the search page, the tags page, this page, and my about me). Removal of easy access to the tags page is a special concern, since this serves as the backbone of organization for my website. As a result, the theme change is temporary.</p>

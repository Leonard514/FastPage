<p>Now I’ll talk about some key takeaways</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#topics-31-32" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topics 3.1-3.2</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Variable names should be concise yet sufficiently describe the purpose of the variable. For example, the variable name <strong>priceApples</strong> is descriptive enough to show its purpose: storing the price of apples</li>
  <li>There are variable types which can be appropriately applied to different situations</li>
  <li>Boolean variables are applied to binary, true and false situations (such as whether someone is hungry)</li>
  <li>Integer/float variables are applied to situations involving numbers, especially those that can be altered by mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.)</li>
  <li>String variables are appropriate for storage of data (in words) or identification numbers where math is not typically applied. They are enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
  <li>Variables can be assigned different ways in different programming languages. Here are some examples:</li>
</ul>

<p>CollegeBoard pseudocode</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>numApples ← 10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Python</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">numApples</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible to assign the value of a variable to another variable. If the variable a value is assigned to already has a value, that value is typically overwritten. Here’s an example in pseudocode:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>data1 ← 10
data2 ← 25
data1 ← data2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, the final value of <strong>data1</strong> would be 25 since the value of <strong>data2</strong> overwrites that of <strong>data1</strong> in the third line.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The last takeaway is that lists can be assigned as variables. These are often put in square brackets ([]) and the entries are separated by commas. The parts of the list are called <strong>elements</strong> and can exhibit the same data types as variables.</li>
  <li>Each element in a list is assigned an index, a nonnegative integer which is associated with the element in future commands.</li>
  <li>It is very important to note that different forms of indexing can exist between programming languages. CollegeBoard pseudocode assigns the first element in a list the index <strong>1</strong>, while other languages (including Python) assign the first element the index <strong>0</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="topics-33-34">
<a class="anchor" href="#topics-33-34" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topics 3.3-3.4</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Lines of code in a program are executed in a specific order. This pattern is known as sequencing.</li>
  <li>Programs often incorporate selection, where associated lines of code are executed if a condition is satisfied. Often, a different set of commands will be executed if a condition is <em>not</em> satisfied. These most commonly take the form of <strong>if statements</strong> in python.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, programs need to execute lines of code on multiple elements in a list. Instead of writing similar lines of code repetitively, an iteration strategy is used. This often consists of a loop (including for loops, while loops, and recursive functions) which executes associated commands on all items in a list or repeatedly until a certain condition is fulfilled (or is not fulfilled).</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are various operators which can apply mathematical operations on integer/float variables.</li>
  <li>Addition (+), Subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) are identical to the operations learned in arithmetic.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The modulus operator (seen as a <strong>%</strong> in Python) performs a division operation but outputs the remainder instead of the quotient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are certain string-related commands in pseudocode that <em>are not on the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf">exam reference sheet</a></em>. Their validity and syntax quirks are therefore uncertain.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">substring(string, n, m)</code> reads a given <strong>string</strong> (or string variable) and starts at the <strong>nth</strong> character of that string. It reads <strong>m</strong> characters from that point. This output can be assigned to a variable.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concat(string1, string2)</code> essentially results in an output of <strong>string1string2</strong> (in other words, the strings mashed together without any spaces). This output can be assigned to a variable.</li>
</ul>

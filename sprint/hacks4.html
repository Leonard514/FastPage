<p><strong>1) What is the counter variable and the condition?</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    for (var i = 10; i &gt; 0; i--) {
   println(i);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The counter variable is <strong>i</strong>, which according to a web search keeps track of the number of times commands associated with the for loop are executed. This is essentially an index.</p>

<p>The condition that the for loop would keep running is that <strong>i &gt; 0</strong> given that as long as this remains true, the for loop will keep executing. Keep in mind that every time the for loop executes, the value of the counter variable decreases by one.</p>

<p><strong>2) How many times will printIn be called?</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
  for (var j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j++) {
    printIn(i * j);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not the best formatting… I’ll assume this second for loop is nested inside of the first for loop.</p>

<p>Both for loops will execute with the index starting at one and increasing by one each time until the index is over 10. Since the j for loop is nested inside the i for loop, <strong>printIn()</strong> will be executed 10 * 10 or 100 times.</p>

<p><strong>3) What is the initial value? What does the while loop check?</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   var numRabbits = 2;
var numYears = 0;
while (numRabbits &lt;= 100) {
    numRabbits += (numRabbits/2 * 30);
    numYears++;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The initial value of the variable <strong>numRabbits</strong> is 2 simply because that’s what it was defined as on the first line.</p>

<p>The initial value of the variable <strong>numYears</strong> is 0 since this was how it was defined on the second line.</p>

<p>The while loop checks if the value of <strong>numRabbits</strong> is less than or equal to 100. If this condition is satisfied, the executed command will be executed. These commands will increase the variable of <strong>numRabbits</strong> by 15 times its original value (essentially multiplying its value by 16 due to the original value also being additively present) and will increase the variable <strong>numYears</strong> by 1.</p>

<p>Notes After Checking</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feel free to interpret the code in terms of the situation (ex: the loop will run if the population of rabbits is less than 100)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1) What is the output?</strong></p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lst</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Line 1 defines the list variable</li>
  <li>Line 2 adds element “Person” to the end fo the list</li>
  <li>Line 3 removes the final element from the list, reverting it to its original form</li>
  <li>Line 4 removes element “your” from the list</li>
  <li>Line 5 adds element “you’re” to index 0 of the list (first element in Python)</li>
  <li>Line 6 prints the output: [“you’re”, “a”, “very”, “skilled”, “individual”]</li>
</ul>

<p>Checker’s note: I’ll have to test if using single quotes and double quotes for string elements in the same list is compatible.</p>

<p><strong>2) Using Lists</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>A sequence of children in order should be represented by a list with each of the children’s names in the list as string elements in order.</li>
  <li>The number of animals in a zoo does not need a list; only an integer variable <strong>numAnimals</strong> is required.</li>
  <li>A list would not be required to repeatedly derive a number because this falls under the function of iteration/loops. This is true unless perhaps each of those derivatives needed to be stored. In that case, a list with float/integer elements would be useful and an append command would be added to the loop. <strong>Any such list would be pointless</strong>, however, because the derivative of a number (constant) is zero. This would result in a list with many zeros.</li>
  <li>Pairs of school classes and the grades of each class would need a special form of list, where each element is a dictionary. This dictionary would probably match the class (type and period) with a corresponding string element and the average grade with a float element. Each class would be one dictionary element in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The fourth part of this question was a little bit vague. I took a bit of creative liberty with it (usually class grades rather than <em>classroom grades</em> are averaged). After a check, it turns out the fourth part was a fourth and fifth part jammed together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 4: Key value pairs of schools and quantities</li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, I’m not sure what the context of the quantities and key value pairs in this question are. This question doesn’t really make too much sense to me so I can’t answer it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 5: grades of a classroom</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes a bit more sense. It seems we want to have a collection of the grades of all the students in a classroom. A list would be appropriate to store the student’s grades.</p>

<p><strong>3) Find the missing line</strong>. This is pseudocode</p>

    IF (mgAmount ≥ mgMin)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>INSERT(aList, i, value) inserts <strong>value</strong> at index <strong>i</strong> in <strong>aList</strong>. All INSERT commands in the answer choices have incorrect syntax (as they have only two arguments)</p>

<p>APPEND(aList, value) inserts <strong>value</strong> as the final position of <strong>aList</strong>.</p>

<p>Option B (which appends any <strong>mgAmount</strong> satisfying the condition of being less than 120 to <strong>bestAmounts</strong>) functions correctly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace 4th element with “Komodo” and 6th element with “Table Mountain”</li>

<p>Answer: sevenWonders ← [“Aurora”, “Grand Canyon”, “Great Barrier Reef”, “Komodo”, “Mount Everest”, “Table Mountain”, “Victoria Falls”]</p>

<p><strong>5) Find the output</strong></p>

<p>I initially though print(lst.pop()) would return an error. But according to some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html">documentation</a>, this actually returns <strong>None</strong>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, knowing list contents will involve incorporating the steps</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: remove last element (234) from list</li>
  <li>Step 2: append string ‘x’ to back of list</li>
  <li>Step 3: This command is weird because you normally specify the index of insertion before what value is inserted. As a result, running this line gets a TypeError as seen below. Due to the error, the print commands are never executed or the output is never printed to terminal.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/TypeError.png" alt=""></p>

<p>ANSWER: (no output)</p>

<p>Now I’m fairly certain that in-class someone argued there would be actual output. I’m willing to hold a contrary position due to me running the code in a .ipynb file.</p>

<p><strong>New Question: Programs intended to display total hours. Do they work?</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
totalMins ← 0
durations ← [32, 56, 28, 27]
FOR EACH duration IN durations
{
   totalMins ← totalMins + duration
}
totalHours ← totalMins / 60
DISPLAY(totalHours)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
totalMins ← 0
durations ← [32, 56, 28, 27]
FOR EACH duration IN durations
{
   totalMins ← totalMins + duration
   totalHours ← totalMins / 60
}
DISPLAY(totalHours)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Program one assigns <strong>totalMins</strong> and <strong>durations</strong>. In the for loop, it adds each element to <strong>totalMins</strong>. After the loop, it divides <strong>totalMins</strong> by 60 to get <strong>totalHours</strong>, then prints <strong>totalHours</strong>. This works as intended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Program two assigns variables in a similar manner to program one, but in the for loop, <strong>totalHours</strong> is also calculated (using the same formula as program one). This does yield the correct <strong>totalHours</strong> but <strong>totalHours</strong> is calculated 4 times in program 2 (as opposed to once in program 1)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, Answer is D</p>

<p>Option A is the best</p>

<ul>
  <li>Defines a list <strong>throws</strong>, <strong>targetDistance</strong>, and <strong>totalDistance</strong>
</li>
  <li>For each entry in throws, displays the difference between the throw’s distance and the target distance. Adds the throw’s distance to <strong>totalDistance</strong>
</li>
  <li>After the for loop, the <strong>avgDistance</strong> is taken by dividing total distance by the length of the list</li>
</ul>

<p>Option B is similar to A, except that the <strong>avgDistance</strong> is calculated by dividing 3. This is not as versatile as Option A (ie it doesn’t work for lists with lengths different than 3)</p>

<p>Options C and D recalculate the <strong>avgDistance</strong> on each execution of the for loop (with variations similar to A and B). This would produce the same result but is not as efficient.</p>

<p>Option E has a logic error which sets <strong>totalDistance</strong> equal to zero at the start of each execution of the for loop. This will result in the <strong>avgDistance</strong> being a third of the final element in the list, 87.3/3 = 29.1. This is unquestionably the worst option.</p>

<p>Question 9 was fun because I managed to prove that all three loops are actually possible! This was the one where a loop should be made to iterate until a user inputs ‘quit’</p>

<p>I have selected the WHILE loops answer and the Recursive loops answer, which were both marked incorrect. I can rebut the claim these answers are incorrect since I have examples of both in python that actually function. The first is recursive (which was the first solution I came up with), and the second is a while loop.</p>

<p>They essentially do the exact same thing: for a list with integer elements 1 through 5, it checks if the index is less than the length; if so, it prints the corresponding element. It executes an opportunity to stop iterating through the list through checking the input for “quit” and executing <strong>return</strong> if it does. It also increases <strong>i</strong> by one for each execution and uses a conditional statement to make sure the index does not stray out of range and iteration can continue.</p>

<p>The intended answer, the for loop, was actually the hardest for me. I needed to come up with a way to prevent the loop from terminating. There was also lots of output errors whenever I changed the contents of the list. Nevertheless, I managed to find a method. However, it does not have infinite capacity; rather, it has a capacity unlikely to be exhausted by human means.</p>

    <p>Writing an Op-Ed Piece</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<p>- 400-800 words, typed, (Copy submitted to teacher must be double-spaced, MLA format)</p>

<p>- Due Tuesday 9/6 at midnight</p>

<p>- You must choose an actual newspaper/journal to submit your piece to. See theopedproject.org for a list of possibilities. <span class="underline">Identify the specific publication that you are submitting to on your piece</span>.</p>

<p>- Clearly defined subject matter that engages reader with opening</p>

<p>- Distinct and plausible recommendations for action and change (failure to do this will result in a full grade level dock)</p>

<p>- Acknowledgment of opposing point of view</p>

<p>- Vibrant word choice reflective of personal voice and writer’s ethos.</p>

<p>According to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>: Your article should be a strong argument about an issue in the news. It should not be a response to a Journal article; that is a letter to the editor. So this means that you should choose something about which you are passionate.</p>

<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.theopedproject.org/"><span class="underline">http://www.theopedproject.org/</span></a> for further resources</p>

<p>According to Duke University:</p>

<p>- <strong>Track the news and jump at opportunities.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Make a single point — well.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Put your main point on top.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Tell readers why they should care.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Offer specific recommendations.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Showing is better than discussing.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Embrace your personal voice.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Play up your personal connection to the readers.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Use short sentences and paragraphs.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Avoid jargon.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Use the active voice.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Avoid tedious rebuttals.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Acknowledge the other side.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Make your ending a winner.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Relax and have fun.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Don’t worry about the headline.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Offer graphics.</strong></p>

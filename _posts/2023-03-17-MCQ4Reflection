# Statement of Intention

This blog post is for reflection on multiple choice questions that I found to be particularly difficult. These include questions that I got wrong as well as questions where I utilized a search engine. Mr. Yeung has permitted use of search engines orally on the condition that students are transparent about their methods. Unlike previous posts where I have used a tabular format, I will format each question with a subheading to give me more space to write longer reflections.

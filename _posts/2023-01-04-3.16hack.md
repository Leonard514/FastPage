# Notes

Simulation = abstraction of complicated natural phenomena... in computers
 - Removes pedantic details, increasing the managibility of the situation

Good for following reasons:
 - Safety (ex: stress-testing buildings/boats without endangering passengers)
 - Cutting Costs (may have potential to skip a physical prototype)
 - Reproducible: Due to the simplification of the abstraction (no confounding variables)
 - Making predictions

 Other notes
  - Reduced cost/risk comes with a trade-off of decreased accuracy compared to real-world situations. However, this deviation in conditions may make simulations suitable for situations where experiments aren't.

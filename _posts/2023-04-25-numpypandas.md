# Notes

### Predictive Analysis

Use lots of data + machine learning to draw predictions!
- ex: predict what items will be popular to start a marketing campaign
- ex: Find a way to break the chain of transmission for a disease outbreak

There are steps!
- Find a problem + source of data
- Get + refine data
- Find patterns
- Get algorithm/model
- Train the model
- Make predictions based on model
- Refine model over time

### NumPy

Good for computations in python. Can focus on analyzing data.

Template Preservation

```python3
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], ndmin=3)

print(a)
```

Dimensions seem to be denoted by each set of brackets...

# Notes

### Predictive Analysis

Use lots of data + machine learning to draw predictions!
- ex: predict what items will be popular to start a marketing campaign
- ex: Find a way to break the chain of transmission for a disease outbreak

There are steps!
- Find a problem + source of data
- Get + refine data
- Find patterns
- Get algorithm/model
- Train the model
- Make predictions based on model
- Refine model over time

Alright, where to start? I got three weeks worth of work here. Apparently I'm supposed to grade 10 create performance task submissions and compare them to college board. I guess the following is below

| Week number | Submissions | 
|-|-|
| Week 1 | Submissions 1-2 |
| Week 2 | Submissions 3-6 |
| Week 3 | Submissions 7-10 |

The rubric is [attached](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf) for reference.

Alright, now I'll start Week 1 I guess

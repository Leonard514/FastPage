Alright, where to start? I got three weeks worth of work here. Apparently I'm supposed to grade 10 create performance task submissions and compare them to college board. I guess the following is below

| Week number | Submissions | 
|-|-|
| Week 1 | Submissions 1-2 |
| Week 2 | Submissions 3-6 |
| Week 3 | Submissions 7-10 |

The rubric is [attached](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf) for reference. There are also some [prompts](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) to be aware of.

Alright, now I'll start Week 1 I guess

# Week 1 Work


### Submission 1

Expect this to be a bit rough since this is my first one. I'm usually quite harsh, and I'm expecting College Board to be pretty lenient. Alright, let's see what's here.

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Student Comments | College Board Score | Comments about College Board's Score |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | Video appropriately shows program input of triangle side lengths and outputs of trignometric values in neat table. The written response includes the inputs and outputs, a certain functionality of the code through the output (trignometric table and side ratios). It is difficult to tell if program purpose is confused with program function, though it seems it is. | 0 | Pretty much the same as what I said. The video demonstrates input and output, and the response appropriately describes input, output, and program functionality (but not program purpose). |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | A list and its fulfilling of the programs purpose are clear. The list, however, is used to store potential outputs (namely the type of triangle), not inputs. The list is named appropriately. The data in the list is represented clearly. I'm going to assume using an output-storage list is not going to be a problem. | 1 | Includes two code segments, namely the data in the list and the data being accessed from the list. The list is named and the data is identified |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | A list is shown as managing output complexity. The student posits that without the list, the types of triangles will have to be put in the return statements, meaning the types of triangles supported are not all in one place. This solution seems to be plausible, as does the use of the list. The student notes that with a list, modification of code is easier since the types of triangles are found in one place. | 0 | Putting all the outputs in one place is not management of complexity, especially since the return statements is a simple replacement. We're looking for something different here. Perhaps I have an idea. The student never showed the code behind the trignometric table scheme, and though each value shown requires but a simple calculation, there are 18 outputs to manage. A list could probably be used to manage complexity in this instance. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The code segments clearly show a student-developed procedure with three parameters (each are essential); the procedure is called soon after it is defined. The student identifies what the procedure does (outputs the ratio of the entered triangular sides) and connects the procedure to the program's function, namely its output being required as part of the user-received output | 1 | The procedure is written and called, with three parameters. The functionality and contribution to the program is stated |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | The student makes a line-by-line explanation of what the algorithm does, though there is no explanation of the overall function of each portion of code (in other words, each line is explained separately). This may make it difficult to understand the function of certain portions of the algorithm until Question 3d is reached. There is sequencing, selection (two if statements), and iteration (depending on if the triangular sides can be simplified). Unfortunately, when explaining the for loop in the code, the student claims that the index will decrease from the *maximum* of previously defined constants (A, B, and C), when in reality it will decrease from the *minimum* of those constants (uses the python **min(A, B, C)** command). Therefore, I cannot award the point even if there was a solid line-by-line explanation, because the code described does not match the description. | 1 | Looks like College Board wasn't paying attention and missed the error. Under normal AP grading conditions where administrators are given little time to grade hundreds of exams, this would be somewhat understandable. However, it's a little surprising that the scores don't get reviewed before they're posted as examples on the official website. |
| Testing | 1 | This one is a bit difficult to work with. The student gives two different inputs and proceeds to state that the first conditional statement (which checks if the given integers are as simplified as possible) is checked for both of them. For the second call, the student also references the remainders conditional statement (in the for loop), which is executed since the first conditional statement failed to pass for the second call. The student is accurate to state that the first if statement is checked for both arguments, and technically part of the code is executed for both calls (that being the first conditional statement). I think I'll let it slide since the way the algorithm treats the two inputs overall is different. | 1 | Two calls with different arguments are described, which result in different code segments being executed. The student identifies the output of each call. |

Kind of messy as expected. I guess it's time for Round 2.


### Submission 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Student Comments | College Board Score | Comments about College Board's Score |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1? | Response 3ai nails the purpose (entertainment). The video demonstrates the ability of the user to use a mouse to draw starting tiles, which then behave according to Conway's game of life. The output is in the form of the changing tile patterns on the screen. The video does not demonstrate the keyboard input (spacebar, p, r), though this is specified in the written response. I'll take mouse input as a sufficient showing of input in the video. | 1 | Pretty much the same as what I said | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | In blocky. Nice. OK, gotta look for that list. The student says there's a **startGrid**, **currentGrid**, and **nextGrid**. This is an identification of the name of the lists, whose purpose (according to the written response) is to store the status of the 10800 cells on the screen using booleans (0 = dead; 1 = alive). The student says there are three lists to prevent overwriting issues as the program cycles through each generation. There are two code segments provided, and it is clear when the lists are being modified and how they are used to define program purpose. The definitions of the lists are not shown, probably since each list is 10800 elements long. However, the first procedure shows how the initial values of the elements in **startGrid** are set (through mouse input). | 1 | Similar to what I said, but only the first list **startGrid** is considered in scoring. Apparently College Board didn't use the second program code segment since everything required (the list being used as part of fulfilling program purpose) was fulfilled in the first segment. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | The student highlights the need to manage 10800 cells. Managing 10800 variables is impractical, so a list must be used. The procedure is able to change the elements of the list from 0 to 1 or vice versa. | 1 | Same as what I said |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | A procedure **replaceList** is defined in the first code segment and is called in other procedures. The procedure has two parameters which will be used to copy the contents of lists onto other list to save the grid positions. The student identified how the procedure will contribute to the functionality of the program. | 1 | In addition to what I said, College Board identified what the student said about the procedure contributing to functionality: it can store cells in a generation, copy them over to another list, and to recall previous generations. 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | There is sequencing, selection (many if statements), and iteration (where one list is copied to another list). The student gives a general overview about how the algorithm works. However, there is not a detailed, step-by-step explanation. | 1 | No need for a line-by-line explanation. It seems an explanation based on segments of the code is sufficient, which in this case described nested if-else statements identifying which list will be copied from, and then which list will be copied to. |
| Testing | 1 | Two call to **replaceList** are identified, one with parameters 0 and 1 (being **current** and **replacement**), and one with parameters 2 and 1. In both instances, the procedure checks the list being copied from, and the list being copied into. The results are identified (in the first call, the **startGrid** overrides the **currentGrid**; in the second call, the **nextGrid** overrides the **currentGrid**) | 1 | Pretty much the same, but College Board quoted the exact parts of the student response that met the criteria (as usual). The student elaborated on how the procedures would interact with the parameters. |

### Submission 3

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Student Comments | College Board Score | Comments about College Board's Score |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | The video demonstrates input on a screen that appears to be a gaming console, with buttons which appear to be activated on-click (it's clear a web browser is open, after all). There are several animals on the screen, and the student uses an on-screen keyboard (which is arranged in alphabetical order) to type the names of the animals that appeared on the screen using the buttons. The letters typed appears as output, as well as whether the student was right or wrong upon submission. In the written response, the student confuses input and output, as well as program functionality and program purpose (though both are present in the response) | 0 | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | There are two program code segments: one with the list **animalImages** with images of animals, and another segment with **animalList** but with the animal names in text form. For the sake of scoring, **animalList** will be considered. The code segments fail to show how the list fulfills the program's purpose since only the list itself was provided, so the student already lost the point before the rest of the response. The student names the list **animallist** and claims the list contains both the animal names and the animal images, which is false. | 
| Managing Complexity | 0 | The student claims the list allows for storage of more than one variable, and that without the list, defining more variables will be necessary and make the code longer. With the small scale of this project, making more variables is not necessarily harder than making the list. It is unclear if the list manages complexity in the program. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | The student has two program segments: one with the procedure **evaluateGuess**, and one segment where this procedure is called. The student describes what the procedure does (compare a user's guess to the animals in the list and determine if it is correct). The student tries to state how the function contributes to the program, but this seems like a restatement of what the procedure does.  |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | There is sequencing, selection, and iteration in the procedure. The student's explanation about how the procedure works is even more generalized than that of Submission 2, in that the student fails to reference the code (relying on a general explanation of how it works). |
| Testing | 1 | The student identifies two calls to the function **dog** and **mouse**, where the condition in each call is the same (if the inputted answer was one of the animals in the list). The outputs are different (the dog output was getting a point, whereas the mouse output was getting a strike), so the differing outputs may be sufficient for getting different code segments to execute. |

# 3.3 Hacks Part 2

1) Given the code segment, give the values of **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d**
```
a ⟵ 7
b ⟵ 1
c ⟵ 3
d ⟵ 4
a ⟵ b
b ⟵ c + d
d ⟵ b
```

I'll make a table of changes for each line
| Line | Change | 
|-|-|
| 1 | a is 7 |
| 2 | b is 1 |
| 3 | c is 3 |
| 4 | d is 4 |
| 5 | a is b (1) |
| 6 | b is sum of c and d (7) |
| 7 | d is b (7) |

```
a ⟵ 1
b ⟵ 7
c ⟵ 3
d ⟵ 7
```

2) Given the code segment: What are the values of hot and cold?
```
hot ⟵ true
cold ⟵ false
cold ⟵ hot
hot ⟵ cold
```
After true was assigned to **hot** and false was assigned to **cold**, **hot8** (true) was assigned to **cold**, making both true. Assigning **cold** to **hot** (true to true) has no effect, so both are true (Answer is 1)

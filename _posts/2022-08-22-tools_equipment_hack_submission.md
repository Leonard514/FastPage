## Hi!

This is a submission for the Tools/Equipment hack. If you want to see index.html, you might as well check out home.

Anyways, better start showing you my stuff. My main github is [here](https://github.com/Leonard514/FastPage). You were probably interested in seeing the insights page as well, so I'll stick it in [here](https://github.com/Leonard514/FastPage/pulse).

Oh yeah, you also wanted to see me using VSCode, which is how I'm writing this page.

## VSCODE

## Notebook
And then there's my Jupyter notebook, which is found at this [link](https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/2022/08/22/print_test.html). Yeah, I know it has the default title. Going to have to ask around to figure out how that stuff works.

Anyways that's all the submission-related stuff, but I think it's also a good idea to keep a journal... of what I've done, and what I have left to do.

## Here is a table of my progress.

| Date | Activities completed |
|-|-|
| August 17 | Class started. Installed VSCode and the windows version of a bunch of programs (oops)|
| August 18 | Installed Windows Subsystem Linux. Installed python, jupyter, anaconda, and a lot of other software the way I was supposed to do it.|
| August 19 | Fastpages development begins. Created the repository and did basic edits |
| August 21 (night) | Fastpages development continues with this post, index.html, and about me. Make the Jupyter notebook. Used VSCode with my fastpages development (including this page)|

## Remaining tasks:
- Refine the Jupyter Notebook (having a title, markdown integration)
- Image integration working fine, although I need a way to control resolution (since some images are massive)

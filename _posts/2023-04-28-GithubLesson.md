Why Github?

- Github is a website used to share coding repositories.
- Github is integrated with Git, which is used for coding repositories. Better than Google Drive
- Git is different from Github as Git is a way to store code and there are commands. Github is the website used to share code.

Git commands
- git clone
- git push
- git config
- git add
- git branch
etc

Which is better, MacOS or windows?
- Windows: More compatible for downloads
- MacOS: ????

But neither is actually better!

List of tools
- VSCode: Syncs to Github. Good for development
- Kernels: Required to run the code

Installations was hard the first time since it was the beginning (it was hard)
- Things got easier as we got used to them (recognizing error messages)


More git commands
- git fork - make your own copy of someone's repository
- git checkout - commit to a test branch (not the main branch)

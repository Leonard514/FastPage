The following are some notes about a few questions that I worked on.

| Question Number | Correct? | Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Yes | I was silly and initially didn't realize that the code segment checking if x was the maximum was disconnected from the code segment checking if y was the maximum. As such, if x was the maximum, z would be displayed as the maximum since the conditional statement of y being greater than x would fail to pass, making the else condition execute |
| 10 | No | Need a boolean expression equivalent to num â‰¥ 15. An answer I had selected (num > 15 AND num = 15) is inherently false, and an OR operator is required instead. I likely lost the point since I wasn't paying attention to the operator within answer I was selecting, or the answer itself. This was likely a careless mistake. |
| 42 | No | This one was a bit tricky; I understood that a simulation can be used to test designs before real-life prototypes are used, as well as the safety of those designs without having to use a crash test. This saves money. Option III was a bit confusing since I thought that this would mean showing the simulation to the customers (which I would expect to be too technical for most people to understand). However, it seems that the presentation of this design can be made user-friendly. I should probably account for this. |

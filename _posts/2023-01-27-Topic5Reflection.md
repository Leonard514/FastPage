# 5.1 Reflection

Questions are pasted below for context

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
1. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?



Let's use a table to answer the first question.

| General Topic | Beneficial Application/Effect | Harmful Application/Effect | 
|-|-|
| Computers can calculate more quickly and more accurately than humans. The discussion here will apply specifically to calculated trajectories. | Computing can be used for greater feats in astronomy coupled with an increase in safety. For example, using a computer to calculate a trajectory to get man on Mars would have less room for error than a human calculation (the existence of errors in the calculations of students in math classes should sufficiently explain this). Computers could also assist in mapping trajectories for space probes. | Increased accuracy of calculated trajectories could increase the accuracy of weapons systems (ex: UAV drones firing missiles), which in turn would result in increased death in a conventional war (since all parties would likely have access to computers at this point in human history). Of course, nations around the world will be forced to implement this since it would be necessary for national security. |
| Self-driving cars | Increased convenience on part of the driver (who doesn't have to drive). Computers have shorter reaction times than the driver, and this can be utilized to prevent accidents. Will likely deprecate traffic infractions (assuming the car is configured to drive under the speed limit). | Any computer connected to the Internet is susceptible to compromise by attackers. As such, attackers can potentially escalate their actions beyond compromising sensitive data to a point where their actions result in deaths.  It is probable that eventually a car's computer would have enough data capacity to store the entire world map independently of the Internet in the future, but attackers may find other ways to attack these systems. Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field. |
| Digital Maps | Added convenience in navigation around unfamiliar areas through automatic route mapping and marking current location. Paper maps require users to orient themselves with their surroundings and plan their own routes, which can consume time. Digital maps can also account for traffic/accidents and adjust routes accordingly (paper maps can't do that) | Digital maps of the entire world could potentially expose important classified sites of national governments (ex: Area 51). This could potentially present national security issues unless those sites are censored on all versions of all digital maps. |


Time to address the elephant in the room, namely the second question. Since this has been a personal issue, I thought it would be best to respond to the issue in the most thorough way possible, and that method is through the use of formal research papers. Note that since video games are often said to have drug-like effects, many of these papers will go into the deep end and make open comparisons.
 - [Experiment 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44670851_Computer_and_Video_Game_Addiction-A_Comparison_between_Game_Users_and_Non-Game_Users)

This should download a PDF of a study.

Notes on Experiment 1:
- Despite the title, this is not actually a comparison between game users and non-game users. This is actually a comparison on the effect of video games on the dopamine receptors of ordinary people compared to people who are recovering from drug addiction.
- The study showed that the dopamine receptors of normal people were significantly impacted by a motorcycle video game, whereas the dopamine receptors of former drug users were not affected as much. The study posited that this was because the drugs released greater amounts of dopamine over time, which decreased the sensitivity of the receptors later.

- [Compilation 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/2/3/347#B66-brainsci-02-00347)
- [Study 2](https://journals.lww.com/nrronline/_layouts/15/oaks.journals/downloadpdf.aspx?an=01300535-201106260-00007)

That should download a PDF with a filename in Chinese characters (the study is in English). I chose this study from the compilation website since it was the study with the greatest sample of people involved. Studies with low sample size do not have good integrity since outliers/variations have greater effect on the results. You'll probably need to look up a lot of field-specific vocabulary (as is often the case for these kinds of studies), including neuroscience and statistics. Here is a more reader-friendly summary of the study:

- There is a wavelength related to brain activity which takes 3/10 of a second to appear after a stimulus.
- The internet addiction group exhibited increased latency and decreased amplitude of this wavelength, which is often observed in different types of addicts.
- After the addicts were treated, the latency decreased but the amplitude remained low. This suggests that partial recovery is possible but Internet addiction can permanently damage the nervous system.

At this point it is safe to declare that the connection between dopamine issues and technology use is no parent conspiracy.

# 5.2 Reflection

Before I talk about the impacts of the digital divide on the lower classes, I'd like to point out that cybersecurity is a crucial consideration when uplifting other people through access to the Internet. It would be imprudent to provide the poor access to computers without also helping them learn to ensure those computers are secure, because otherwise their data could be compromised by malicious individuals.


Here are some questions (copy-pasted for context)

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
1. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
1. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?


For the first question, learning how to secure one's own computer is strictly necessary for digital empowerment. People without the ability to secure their own computers are at risk of having their personal information stolen by attackers. After this, one may be able to look up reference guides in the field of their choice to supplement their learning in the workforce.

For the second question, one can teach others how to secure their own systems by running a cybersecurity-related club, help others with coding projects, or simply teaching someone how to research online. I find greater satisfaction with one-on-one support than supporting a group of students, mostly since I can guarantee that a given student would get the help he/she needs.

For the third question, Del Norte has done a fair job in distributing chromebooks to students who do not have computers. There are also computer systems available for use in the library. When I took 3D Computer Animation as a Freshman (mainly to get my arts graduation requirement), Mr. Askegreen provided MacOS systems to work on the projects in class (working on projects at home required a personal computer with the software installed, though it was reasonably possible to complete the projects with the given class time if you were paying attention and/or you didn't go overboard; I tend to do the latter). The use of ContentKeeper as a Wi-Fi blocker has legitimate uses (such as preventing students from seeing illicit content online or downloading malicious software), but it sometimes blocks websites that I try to access when researching how certain commands work (for this class). This can be annoying for students who do not have a VPN and/or a PC. It is imprudent to remove ContentKeeper since this may expose students to malware or other illicit content. If it is possible for the IT team to take steps to allow sites that provide documentation on how harmless commands work (for the purposes of computer science classes), this step could be taken. Otherwise, I do not have alternatives to suggest since an alternative could cause larger problems.

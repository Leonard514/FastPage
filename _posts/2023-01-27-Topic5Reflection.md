# 5.1 Reflection

Questions are pasted below for context

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
1. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?



Let's use a table to answer the first question.

| General Topic | Beneficial Application/Effect | Harmful Application/Effect | 
|-|-|
| Computers can calculate more quickly and more accurately than humans. The discussion here will apply specifically to calculated trajectories. | Computing can be used for greater feats in astronomy coupled with an increase in safety. For example, using a computer to calculate a trajectory to get man on Mars would have less room for error than a human calculation (the existence of errors in the calculations of students in math classes should sufficiently explain this). Computers could also assist in mapping trajectories for space probes. | Increased accuracy of calculated trajectories could increase the accuracy of weapons systems (ex: UAV drones firing missiles), which in turn would result in increased death in a conventional war (since all parties would likely have access to computers at this point in human history). Of course, nations around the world will be forced to implement this since it would be necessary for national security. |
| Self-driving cars | Increased convenience on part of the driver (who doesn't have to drive). Computers have shorter reaction times than the driver, and this can be utilized to prevent accidents. Will likely deprecate traffic infractions (assuming the car is configured to drive under the speed limit). | Any computer connected to the Internet is susceptible to compromise by attackers. As such, attackers can potentially escalate their actions beyond compromising sensitive data to a point where their actions result in deaths.  It is probable that eventually a car's computer would have enough data capacity to store the entire world map independently of the Internet in the future, but attackers may find other ways to attack these systems. Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field. |
| Digital Maps | Added convenience in navigation around unfamiliar areas through automatic route mapping and marking current location. Paper maps require users to orient themselves with their surroundings and plan their own routes, which can consume time. Digital maps can also account for traffic/accidents and adjust routes accordingly (paper maps can't do that) | Digital maps of the entire world could potentially expose important classified sites of national governments (ex: Area 51). This could potentially present national security issues unless those sites are censored on all versions of all digital maps. |


Time to address the elephant in the room, namely the second question.

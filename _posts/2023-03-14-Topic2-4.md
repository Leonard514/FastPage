# Class Notes

The __init__ method is the constructor for all of the objects related to the users.

The following notes about the class User

The db.Model is the parameter for the creation of the class User. In Object Orienting Program, information is taken from the database (info inherited from db.Model). 

For each attribute, @property (getter) and a setter. For getting and CRUD (create, read, update, delete), getting may correspond to Creating, Reading, and Updating.


The class added breakpoints to u6 and to u2 of the **Initial Data** code segment. initUsers() at the bottom is highlighted since the function is not run until the final line calls it. All the user information is contained within the call to the class defined as 6 user-variables.

It is good to convert data at the end to JSON because this is a universal language; this allows it to be more usable (ex: using APIs)


# Notes on all the Code Blocks

## Block 1

The first code block starts by importing libraries and starting a flask instance. It finds the sqlite.db file and sets a few configurations related to Flask and SQLAlchemy, including the secret key and where the database file is. THe **SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS** setting is set to false; this saves system resources according to this [stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33738467/how-do-i-know-if-i-can-disable-sqlalchemy-track-modifications)

## Block 2

This imports more libraries and is also where the class **User** is defined. At that, various columns for the SQL database are defined (including the **_name**, **_uid**, **_password**, and **_dob**). There are configurations for the maximum length (indicated to be 255 characters by **db.string(255)**, and the _uid must be unique (unique=True).

# Class Notes

The __init__ method is the constructor for all of the objects related to the users.

The following notes about the class User

The db.Model is the parameter for the creation of the class User. In Object Orienting Program, information is taken from the database (info inherited from db.Model). 

For each attribute, @property (getter) and a setter. For getting and CRUD (create, read, update, delete), getting may correspond to Creating, Reading, and Updating.


The class added breakpoints to u6 and to u2 of the **Initial Data** code segment. initUsers() at the bottom is highlighted since the function is not run until the final line calls it. All the user information is contained within the call to the class defined as 6 user-variables.

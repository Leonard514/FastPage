JavaScript is most important web dev language. Need to do the hacks

Get the notebook

Output in HTML and CSS

What is being styled: Everything that has the id "output" - see the #output, which corresponds to div id="output"

Can also have JS interact with this ID. Use JS.


JS output stuffs

console.log()
element.text()
alert()
document.getElementById("output").textContent



Programming languages have data types (loosely typed) - don't specify the type in advance

Can't send different data types to the same procedure in Java... this may not apply to JavaScript

Class: Used to define databases... has methods/functions inside. Make new objects from the classes


New features: Can sort in ascending/descending order and also search list entries

JavaScript is most important web dev language. Need to do the hacks

Get the notebook

Output in HTML and CSS

What is being styled: Everything that has the id "output" - see the #output, which corresponds to div id="output"

Can also have JS interact with this ID. Use JS.


JS output stuffs

console.log()
element.text()
alert()
document.getElementById("output").textContent



Programming languages have data types (loosely typed) - don't specify the type in advance

Can't send different data types to the same procedure in Java... this may not apply to JavaScript

Class: Used to define databases... has methods/functions inside. Make new objects from the classes


New features: Can sort in ascending/descending order and also search list entries - can do 4 lines like import lines.

JavaScript of import lines is link and script tags


```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.25/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.25/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js"></script>
```

Do inspect mode > console

Double-arrow to re-run the whole notebook - console logs messages on the right - the table then happens. There aren't any sorting and searching, but there's a temporary fix. There's a type error with the DataTable.

There are <th> and <td> - table headings and table data
  
  
There is a little bug where you can install the ChatGPT plugin, and a comment for the ChatGPT review
  
When running the class Classroom, you can open up the object using the arrows in the console in inspect. There's lots of nesting inside the object

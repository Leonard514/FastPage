Why Sort?


- Sort a list in ascending/descending order for binary search
- Sort into categories



Start with Numbers

# Warm Up

- If the left number has a lesser value than that of the right number, then switch the numbers
- Find the least number then put as first element, then next least number than put as the next element, repeat in like sequence until all numbers sorted

example: [9, 62, 78, 54, 18, 74, 58, 84, 20, 46]

[9. 18, 20, 46, 54, 58, 62, 74, 78, 84]

Another (ineffective) method - randomize the list until the right order is achieved

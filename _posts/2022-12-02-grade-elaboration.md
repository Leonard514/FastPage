I'll start with a highly informative table.

Now I'll talk about some key takeaways

# Topics 3.1-3.2

- Variable names should be concise yet sufficiently describe the purpose of the variable. For example, the variable name **priceApples** is descriptive enough to show its purpose: storing the price of apples
- There are variable types which can be appropriately applied to different situations
 - Boolean variables are applied to binary, true and false situations (such as whether someone is hungry)
 - Integer/float variables are applied to situations involving numbers, especially those that can be altered by mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
 - String variables are appropriate for storage of data (in words) or identification numbers where math is not typically applied. They are enclosed in quotation marks.
- Variables can be assigned different ways in different programming languages. Here are some examples:

CollegeBoard pseudocode
```
numApples ← 10
```

Python
```python
numApples = 10
```
- It is possible to assign the value of a variable to another variable. If the variable a value is assigned to already has a value, that value is typically overwritten. Here's an example in pseudocode:

```
data1 ← 10
data2 ← 25
data1 ← data2
```

In this case, the final value of **data1** would be 25 since the value of **data2** overwrites that of **data1** in the third line.


- The last takeaway is that lists can be assigned as variables. These are often put in square brackets ([]) and the entries are separated by commas. The parts of the list are called **elements** and can exhibit the same data types as variables.
- Each element in a list is assigned an index, a nonnegative integer which is associated with the element in future commands.
 - It is very important to note that different forms of indexing

# Statement of Intention

This blog post is for reflection on multiple choice questions that I found to be particularly difficult. These include questions that I got wrong as well as questions that I found to be particularly difficult. I will not go over all of the questions to reduce vulnerabilities in the integrity system.

# Reflection

Here are a few of the questions that were of interest.

## Question 3: Citizen Science!!!

Apparently citizen science exists. I've never heard of this before. If there's anything I'm guessing this has something to do with involving a group of people representative of the population.

## Iterative and Incremental Processes of Development

## Question 16 and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act

I was 50% certain when I was taking the test that this was legislation that was proposed, protested against, and ultimately never happened. Regardless, the music seller was licensed, so I thought copyright infringement was unlikely.
TODO: Look it up.

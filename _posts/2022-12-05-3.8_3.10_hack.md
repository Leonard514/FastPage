# Practice Notes: Lesson 8

**1) What is the counter variable and the condition?**

```
    for (var i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
   println(i);
}
```

The counter variable is **i**, which according to a web search keeps track of the number of times commands associated with the for loop are executed. This is essentially an index.

The condition that the for loop would keep running is that **i > 0** given that as long as this remains true, the for loop will keep executing. Keep in mind that every time the for loop executes, the value of the counter variable decreases by one.

**2) How many timmes will print(ln) be called?**

```
   for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  for (var j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
    println(i * j);
  }
}
```

I've been asked to display some images in Jupyter Notebooks. Unfortunately, I do not have a Jupyter editor at the moment so I will have to resort to Markdown.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/green-square-16.png "The first image is a small green square")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/clouds-impression.png "The second image is medium sized and depicting clouds")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lassen-volcano.jpg "The third image is large and depicts volcanoes")

Prompt 1: Describe some of the meta data...

The image size, which could be measured by the number of pixels, affects the file size of a given image. If the file size of an image becomes too large, the image could be difficult to transport across the Internet. As such, the image file must be compressed, which decreases its file size. [According to a College Board video](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?apd=p13chxi8d3&unit=2), this is achieved through using an in-file dictionary to decrease the number of characters in a file, thereby decreasing its size. According to this same video, there are two types of compression: Lossless compression (all data is conserved) and lossy compression (not all data is conserved, though there is no need to do so). Generally, lossy compression reduces the file size more effectively.

In terms of images, there are many file extensions that are available. Some of the more common file extensions are the .PNG and the .JPEG extensions. According to [this source](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/PNG-Portable-Network-Graphics), .JPEG uses lossy compression while .PNG uses lossless compression. When lossy compression is utilized, the change in image colors are not easily perceptible.

Prompt 2: Playing around with provided sample code

Lily (my partner) had some issues loading a Jupyter renderer and a dependency. She just reloaded VSCode and everything worked fine. The issue was relatively strange.

As for image paths, paths are important when working with images so that the program can appropriately find the location of the image within its filesystem. If a man doesn't know where his favorite place is, he can't use it. In a similar manner, if the program doesn't know where an image is, the program can't display it.

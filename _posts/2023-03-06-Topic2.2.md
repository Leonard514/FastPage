I've been asked to display some images in Jupyter Notebooks. Unfortunately, I do not have a Jupyter editor at the moment so I will have to resort to Markdown.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/green-square-16.png "The first image is a small green square")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/clouds-impression.png "The second image is medium sized and depicting clouds")

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lassen-volcano.jpg "The third image is large and depicts volcanoes")

Prompt 1: Describe some of the meta data...

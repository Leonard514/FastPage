</ul><p>Why Github?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Github is a website used to share coding repositories.</li>
  <li>Github is integrated with Git, which is used for coding repositories. Better than Google Drive</li>
  <li>Git is different from Github as Git is a way to store code and there are commands. Github is the website used to share code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Git commands</p>
<ul>
  <li>git clone</li>
  <li>git push</li>
  <li>git config</li>
  <li>git add</li>
  <li>git branch
etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is better, MacOS or windows?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows: More compatible for downloads</li>
  <li>MacOS: ????</li>
</ul>

<p>But neither is actually better!</p>

<p>List of tools</p>
<ul>
  <li>VSCode: Syncs to Github. Good for development</li>
  <li>Kernels: Required to run the code</li>
</ul>

<p>Installations was hard the first time since it was the beginning (it was hard)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Things got easier as we got used to them (recognizing error messages)</li>
</ul>

<p>More git commands</p>
<ul>
  <li>git fork - make your own copy of someone’s repository</li>
  <li>git checkout - commit to a test branch (not the main branch)</li>
</ul>

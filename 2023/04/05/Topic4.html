  <p>As we have learned, a computer needs aa program to do something smart.  The sequence of a program initiates a series of actions with the computers Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on program instructions provided.  The CPU retrieives and stores the data it acts upon in Random Access Memory (RAM). Between the CPU, RAM, and Storage Devices a computer can work with many programs and large amounts of data.</p>

<p>The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for <strong><em>communication between web browsers and web servers</em></strong>. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts.  The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller <strong><em>chunks called “segments”</em></strong>. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection.</p>

<p>The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then <strong><em>encapsulating the data into IP packets</em></strong>. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network.</p>

<p>The “network” layer is responsible for <strong><em>routing data packets between networks</em></strong> using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and <strong><em>network congestion</em></strong> control.</p>

<h3 id="fault-tolerance">
<a class="anchor" href="#fault-tolerance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fault Tolerance</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Watch both Daily videos for 4.2</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<p>“The network activity” is a bit vague given there were lots of networks in the College Board Videos</p>

<p><img src="/FastPage/images/network.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There were lots of networks like this on the College Board video where there were devices with connections, with one device having only one connection. In this case, the network is not fault-tolerant since device F needs to be connected to device C to be connected to the network. As such, if this connection fails, device F is entirely disconnected from the network.</p>

<p>Fault tolerance has to do with maintaining connectivity to the Internet even if a device or a connection (interface) fails. As such, connections between devices must be redundant to ensure if one device/connection goes down, it is still possible to ensure connectivity between devices. In terms of routing networks, Hot Standby Routing Protocol is used to configure routing in case a router goes down, and this is covered in my <a href="https://leonard514.github.io/FastPage/notes/MCQ3reflection">Final Exam 2 Reflection</a></p>

  <p>Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily vidoe 4.3.  Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively.  Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks…</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend archeticture?
    <ul>
      <li>The frontend architecture manages the appearance of the webpage. Aspects of this include any headers and backgrounds that are involved. Images are also stored and displayed as appropriate on the webpage. Certain programming languages (including CSS and SASS) can be used to tweak the appearance of webpages (text color, background color, etc.)</li>
      <li>The backend architecture manages all of the data that is collected as input or is needed to be outputted to the website. For example, for a login page, a backend is needed to store all of the authorized credentials and as a place to store new credentials when people make new accounts. The backend can also store data to be displayed on tables; it is possible to display these tables on the website and allow users to click rows/columns to filter in ascending/descending order.</li>

  <li>Analyze this command in Docker: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS="--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086"</code>.
